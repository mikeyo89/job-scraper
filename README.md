## Welcome to the Job Scraper project!

This project will analyze Indeed's HTML and extrapolate summary data -- such as the number of results that seek a particular Framework or Programming Language.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repo using git or github desktop.
2. In a local or virtual environment, ensure to install pip or pip3.\
   This can be done by checking out the documentation on <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">pip</a>.
3. Navigate to the project directory -- only 1 folder (src) and the various files will be located here.
4. In a command shell -- such as bash, windows shell, or zsh -- run the following command:\
    *pip3 install -r requirements.txt*
5. Navigate into the src directory.

### All dependencies are now installed!

**From here, simply run any of the following files:**
```
1. mvp.py
2. mvp2.py
3. poc.py
4. poc2.py
```

_**Note:** `mvp.py` `mvp2.py` make **real** `GET` requests to Indeed. If you would prefer not to do so, run `poc.py` or `poc2.py` instead._

That is all, folks!
